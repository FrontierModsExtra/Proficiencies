        "description": "The first in a new genre of guns, termed \"personal defense weapons.\"  FN designed the P90 to use their proprietary high-velocity 5.7x28mm ammunition.  Made to fulfill NATO requests for a weapon chambered in a more suitable cartridge for defeating body armor than standard 9x19mm submachine guns, the FN P90 is excellent at firing short and controllable bursts manageably.  The PDW’s small and high-speed 5.7mm ammunition, of which 50 rounds fit in the P90’s top mounted magazine, packs quite the lethal payload for any armored opponent, whilst the firearm’s bullpup design makes it commendably compact to boot."
