It does not have a buttstock or front sight post, and the smooth front hand guard does nothing to protect you from the potentially scorching hot barrel collar, making it slightly less than ergonomic.  You could screw it into a firing port if you were so inclined.  The fire selector says only 'SAFE' and 'AUTO'.  You can't help but wonder which one is preferable."
