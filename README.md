# Proficiencies

This small mod adds a _firearm-platform proficiency_ mechanic. The more enemies you hit with a particular group of related firearms, the higher your proficiency with it; the higher your proficiency, the higher the handling and accuracy benefits.

This system is inspired by _Escape from Tarkov_ and its own weapon mastery system.

This version of the mod is intended for the **0.H** stable release.

## Status

This mod is **in development**. An initial implementation, delivering ~95% of expected mechanics, has been released for the AK family of rifles. In the future, the mod aims to cover every single family of firearms in the base game, including orphans ("families" with only a single gun), extraterrestrial weaponry, and the latest terrestrial developments.

Embedded support for modded weapons is anticipated, though the details of its implementations are still being figured out.
